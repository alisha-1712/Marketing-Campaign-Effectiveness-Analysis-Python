# Marketing Campaign Effectiveness Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the effectiveness of online marketing campaigns using key engagement and conversion metrics.  
The objective is to identify what drives clicks versus conversions and provide data-driven recommendations for campaign optimization.

## Business Objectives
- Evaluate ad performance across placements, formats, and topics
- Compare engagement (CTR) with conversion outcomes
- Identify high-value audience segments
- Highlight optimization opportunities in the marketing funnel

## Dataset

- **Records:** 10,000
- **Key Features:**
  - Demographics: Age, Gender, Income, Location
  - Ad attributes: Ad Type, Ad Topic, Ad Placement
  - Performance metrics: CTR, Conversion Rate, Clicks

## Tools & Technologies

## Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and validation
- Feature engineering (age groups, income bands)
- CTR and conversion analysis
- Ad placement and ad type effectiveness
- Audience segmentation insights
- CTR vs Conversion mismatch analysis
- Heatmap analysis of ad type × placement performance

##  Key Insights
- CTR is relatively stable across ad formats and placements
- Conversion rates vary significantly by audience quality

- High engagement does not always translate into conversions

## Recommendations
